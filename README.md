# Product Recommendation System for E-commerce Website

This project implements a product recommendation system using machine learning algorithms. The main goal is to analyze product data and recommend items based on Bayesian Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, and K-Means clustering.

## Project Overview
This system is designed to provide personalized product recommendations for users on an e-commerce platform. It leverages various machine learning algorithms to predict user preferences and group similar products.

## Project Structure
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading the `amazon.csv` dataset, cleaning data, and preparing it for model training.
- **Bayesian Logistic Regression**: Predicts user ratings based on product price.
- **Ridge Regression**: Estimates user ratings for different products based on product features.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups products into clusters based on similar features.

## Features
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - **Bayesian Logistic Regression**: Calculates the probability of high-rated products.
  - **Ridge Regression**: Reduces overfitting in linear models.
  - **K-Means Clustering**: Segments products into clusters for similar items.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays relationships between features and clusters.
