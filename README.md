# Product Recommendation System for E-commerce Website

This project implements a recommendation system for electronic products using two primary approaches: a popularity-based recommendation model and a collaborative filtering model. This solution aims to recommend products to users based on various factors, including popular trends and individual user preferences.

**Project Structure**
1. Data Preprocessing
Loaded the dataset, added headers, and removed unnecessary columns like timestamps.
Subsetted the data for efficient computation and created a dense dataset for modeling.
Analyzed basic statistical properties and distribution of ratings to understand the data better.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted data exploration to understand rating distributions, unique users, and unique products.
Plotted ratings distribution and top-rated users to visualize product interactions.

3. Recommendation Models

 **1. Popularity-Based Recommendation Model**
Built a model that recommends top products based on popularity (frequency of ratings) among users.
This model is non-personalized and provides the same recommendations to all users.
Recommended the most popular items, ideal for new users with no history of interactions.

**2. Collaborative Filtering Model (User-Based)**
Implemented user-based collaborative filtering to personalize recommendations based on user preferences.
Used Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to handle the sparsity of the user-item matrix.
Predicted ratings and recommended products based on similar users' historical data.

**Model Evaluation**
Calculated the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the accuracy of collaborative filtering recommendations.
Compared actual and predicted ratings to gauge the modelâ€™s performance.

**Top-K Recommendations**
Generated top-K recommendations for each user by selecting items with the highest predicted ratings.
Tailored suggestions based on user history, providing a personalized experience.

*Insights**
Popularity Model: Provides the same product recommendations to all users based on global popularity, regardless of individual preferences.
Collaborative Filtering Model: Delivers personalized recommendations based on past user behavior, making it more suitable for users with interaction history.

**Conclusion**
The popularity-based model is useful for general recommendations, particularly for new users with limited or no data.
The collaborative filtering model outperforms in providing personalized recommendations, especially effective for users with significant past interactions.

**Future Enhancements**
Explore additional recommendation techniques such as content-based filtering or hybrid models for better personalization.
Integrate more advanced evaluation metrics like Precision and Recall to measure recommendation relevance more accurately.
Further optimize the model to handle larger datasets and reduce sparsity.
This project demonstrates a foundational approach to recommendation systems using collaborative filtering and popularity-based models in electronic product suggestions.
